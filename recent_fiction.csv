A woman tries to negotiate life with her arthritis witch and her boyfriend's seizure elf. The Germanic goddess Berchta, tired of being a fearsome hag, shows up in a woman's apartment wanting to be flat-mates. In the fictional worlds depicted in Instances of Head-switching, sphinxes are kept as pets, unicorns are raised on ranches, and Sisyphus has escaped from Hades and is happily working as a bagger at a grocery store. But characters still struggle to pay bills, deal with cranky customers and bosses, and navigate life with partial vision, limited mobility, and chronic diseases. Focusing on themes of embodiment, disability, and economic insecurity, Teresa Milbrodt offers witty and inventive tales full of compassion for her cash-strapped, hard-luck characters. The collection includes stories originally published in Guernica, Strange Horizons, PANK, and other journals""--Back cover.",,0998463450,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/0998463450.jpg

It all changes with one phone call. “I need you, Hadley.”

And she goes. Of course, she goes.

With no recollection of their divorce or the tragedy that led to it, Jace must rely on Hadley to help him remember. But as the two spend time together at Hadley's home, a spark of the love they once shared is reignited. The dislike they’d harbored since the divorce becomes something that looks a lot like friendship. Can it become more?

He’s lost AF inside his own head, but what if getting lost is the only way back to the happiness they’d once shared?

Will Jace and Hadley be able to find their way back to each other despite the pain and confusion of the past? Or will the secrets of their past keep them apart forever?",,9.79839E+12,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9798388552570.jpg

Modernist Crisis and the Pedagogy of Form examines how Virginia Woolf, Samuel R. Delany, and J. M. Coetzee developed literary strategies in common to cope with crisis periods they were anticipating, living through, or looking back on. Matthew Cheney outlines how the three writers shaped their art to create an author/audience relationship congruent with the goals of critical pedagogy espoused by such thinkers as Paulo Freire and bell hooks. Seeking to stimulate ethical thought, Woolf, Delany, and Coetzee required their readers to be active interpreters of their texts' forms, contents, and contexts. By pushing against fiction's fictionality, these writers of very different backgrounds, geographies, privileges, situations, tastes, and styles discovered complex ways to address the world wars in England, the AIDS crisis in New York, and apartheid in South Africa, going so far as to question the value of fiction itself""--",,9.7815E+12,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781501355912.jpg

Then.
Misbah is a dreamer and storyteller, newly married to Toufiq in an arranged match. After their young life is shaken by tragedy, they come to the United States and open the Clouds’ Rest Inn Motel, hoping for a new start.
 
Juniper, California. Now.
Salahudin and Noor are more than best friends; they are family. Growing up as outcasts in the small desert town of Juniper, California, they understand each other the way no one else does. Until The Fight, which destroys their bond with the swift fury of a star exploding.  
 
Now, Sal scrambles to run the family motel as his mother Misbah’s health fails and his grieving father loses himself to alcoholism. Noor, meanwhile, walks a harrowing tightrope: working at her wrathful uncle’s liquor store while hiding the fact that she’s applying to college so she can escape him—and Juniper—forever.
 
When Sal’s attempts to save the motel spiral out of control, he and Noor must ask themselves what friendship is worth—and what it takes to defeat the monsters in their pasts and the ones in their midst.  
 
From one of today’s most cherished and bestselling young adult authors comes a breathtaking novel of young love, old regrets, and forgiveness—one that’s both tragic and poignant in its tender ferocity.",,059320235X,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/059320235X.jpg

Now, she goes by the one the Elantian colonizers gave her when they invaded her kingdom, killed her mother, and outlawed her people’s magic. She spends her nights as a songgirl in Haak’gong, a city transformed by the conquerors,  and spends her days scavenging for remnants of the past. For anything that might help her understand the strange mark burned into her arm by her mother, in her last act before she died.

　No one can see the mysterious mark—an untranslatable Hin character—except Lan. Until the night a boy appears at the teahouse and saves her life.

　Zen is a practitioner—one of the fabled magicians of the Last Kingdom, whose abilities were rumored to be drawn from the demons they communed with. Magic believed to be long lost. Magic to be hidden from the Elantians at all costs.

　When Zen comes across Lan’s unusual qi, he recognizes what she is: a practitioner with a powerful ability hidden in the mark on her arm. He’s never seen anything like it—but he knows: if there are answers, they lie deep in the pine forests and misty mountains of the Last Kingdom, with an order of practitioning masters planning to overthrow the Elantian regime.

　Both Lan and Zen have secrets buried deep within. Fate has connected them, but their destiny remains unwritten. Both hold the power to liberate their land. And both hold the power to destroy the world.",,9.78059E+12,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780593487532.jpg

Infamous Cape Town artist Sophie Tugiers has been missing for several years. Her mysterious disappearance caused a brief ripple before dissolving into a distant media memory. Sophie's controversial art alienated many people: those who didn't consider her a sell-out thought her last exhibition was sadistic - after all, one of her experimental participants committed suicide. James Dempster is a jaded filmmaker with a whiskey problem. Following his acrimonious divorce, he needs a project to relaunch his stalled career. When he discovers he's living in the flat Sophie once rented, he is drawn into her sinister tale. What really happened to Sophie? What are her friends and enemies hiding? After James's flat is ransacked and his research stolen, he realises unearthing the truth could lead not to his redemption but to his demise.  The Artist Vanishes  explores ambition and success, guilt and responsibility, the ethics around animal research, and art's lasting impact on those it touches.""--",,1415210314,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/1415210314.jpg

As they peruse covers, read stories and fragments of stories, they begin to suspect that the comics contain hidden messages and... a threat. Fiction and reality blur; sanity and madness become increasingly intertwined as the reader becomes convinced the key to their predicament is to be found between the panels of the strange books. With a dizzying array of inventive visual and narrative styles, Ex Libris continues the line of exploration and play that Madden initiated with 99 Ways to Tell a Story: Exercises in Style. Ex Libris is a tribute to the meta-fictional tradition of writers like Jorge Luis Borges, Julio Cort  zar, Vladimir Nabokov, and Italo Calvino (whose novel, If on a Winter's Night a Traveler, was the inspiration).""--Amazon.com.",,9.78194E+12,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781941250440.jpg

Treasure finds herself face to face with the Devil who controls ministers, doctors and policemen. A secret society like no other in the history of Africa comes alive once again. As she is drawn into supremacy, the chains of material slavery keep following Treasure and her best friend Lintle Kente. After years of sexual entertainment and high flying, can their master let them go? With the increasing number of dead bodies, drugs and cults, will this love affair prove to be a way of life for many?

Spanning three continents, Butter Honey Pig Bread tells the interconnected stories of three Nigerian women: Kambirinachi and her twin daughters, Kehinde and Taiye. Kambirinachi believes that she is an Ogbanje, or an Abiku, a non-human spirit that plagues a family with misfortune by being born and then dying in childhood to cause a human mother misery. She has made the unnatural choice of staying alive to love her human family but lives in fear of the consequences of her decision. Kambirinachi and her daughters become estranged from one another because of a trauma that Kehinde experiences in childhood, which leads her to move away and cut off all contact. She ultimately finds her path as an artist and seeks to raise a family of her own, despite her fear that she won't be a good mother. Meanwhile, Taiye is plagued by guilt for what her sister suffered and also runs away, attempting to fill the void of that lost relationship with casual flings with women. She eventually discovers a way out of her stifling loneliness through a passion for food and cooking. But now, after more than a decade of living apart, Taiye and Kehinde have returned home to Lagos. It is here that the three women must face each other and address the wounds of the past if they are to reconcile and move forward. For readers of African diasporic authors such as Teju Cole and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Butter Honey Pig Bread is a story of choices and their consequences, of motherhood, of the malleable line between the spirit and the mind, of finding new homes and mending old ones, of voracious appetites, of queer love, of friendship, faith, and above all, family.""--",,155152824X,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/155152824X.jpg

It's August. The rain shows no sign of stopping. Licorice, a reclusive middle-aged filmmaker, has only a brief window of opportunity to realise her long-cherished film project about the story of Nan Kemp. A grisly story of infanticide, cannibalism and rough justice remembered on the map: local kids have dared and scared each other to run round 'the witch's grave' since way back when. The rebuilt windmill provides a hypothetical link between the time from which Nan's 'story' springs and the present. For Angie, Licorice herself is something of a legend. Angie's ex-lover Roy, sees Licorice as a bully and potential rival. Pete, co-directing the film, is consumed with unrequited lust for Angie... While Angie and Roy are definitively not speaking to each other, Pete and Licorice argue endlessly over how to shoot scenes and the direction the film is going to take. But Licorice has a secret only Pete knows. 25 Well-worn tropes lifted from films such as The Mask of Satan, The Blair Witch Project and Irma Vep give this narrative about failing to create a narrative its shape. The idea of folk horror intrigues Licorice."" -- book works.",,191257005X,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/191257005X.jpg

When she is injured in a terrible accident while reading, Cat finds that her powers as a reader are almost supernaturally enhanced. Over the next hundred years, her life is entwined with the lives and legends of the greatest writers of the time -- James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, Hemingway, Kerouac, Sylvia Plath, Patrick White and a host of others. Cat is their secret confidante, first reader and muse; the hidden constant in their very different literary quests. And for one of them she becomes much more, when a question is asked which only Cat can answer. Cat's adventures take her around the world and back again in an epic tale of imagination, eccentricity and Promethean struggle.",,1925984834,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/1925984834.jpg

One day, on their usual morning trek in the mountains, they notice something in the bushes, something that shouldn't be there. At the end of a hidden track, there's a young girl, barely in her twenties, badly hurt and unconscious. Two years later, the lost girl is now called Shanaya, and she helps out at her foster parents' cafe. Every resident of Fagu is aware of the mystery behind Shanaya's past, but she herself remembers nothing of it. The residents of Fagu have kept Shanaya's secret, and protected her from harm. She is one of them, and her life is peaceful, until a stranger arrives in town, triggering within Shanaya a flood of memories and nightmares. Determined to learn the truth about her past, Shanaya lets the stranger lead her on a dangerous path of discovery.",,935489335X,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/935489335X.jpg

Though quick to admit that she often found her roles as a housewife and mother less than satisfying, Missy once led a bustling life driven by two children, an accomplished and celebrated husband, and a Classics degree from Cambridge. Now her husband is gone, her daughter is estranged after a shattering argument, and her son has moved to his wife's native Australia, taking Missy's beloved only grandchild half-a-world away. She spends her days sipping sherry, avoiding people, and rattling around in her oversized, under-decorated house waiting for ... what exactly? The last thing Missy expects is for two perfect strangers and one spirited dog named Bob to break through her prickly exterior and show Missy just how much love she still has to give. In short order, Missy finds herself in the jarring embrace of an eclectic community that simply won't take no for an answer--including a rambunctious mutt-on-loan whose unconditional love gives Missy a reason to re-enter the world one muddy paw print at a time. Filled with wry laughter and deep insights, The Love Story of Missy Carmichael is a coming-of-old story that shows us it's never too late to forgive yourself and, just as important, it's never too late to love.",,0525542469,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/0525542469.jpg

Sobhuza is a freedom fighter and doing important work, and Joseph has learned not to ask questions. But when Chanda, his mother, disappears without a trace, leaving him and his siblings alone, Joseph knows that something is terribly wrong. And so begins a journey, physically arduous and dangerous and emotionally fraught, that no 14-year-old boy should have to undertake alone. Following the most tenuous of threads, Joseph finds some unlikely guides along the way: courageous Leila and her horses; Sis Violet and the guerrilla unit she commands; Mr Chikwedere, stonecutter and illicit trader; Madala at the Lesedi Repatriation Camp, who helps him find his voice; and Aunt Susie Juma, unofficial Zambian ambassador in Yeoville, Johannesburg, whose detective skills are legendary. As Joseph navigates unfamiliar and often hostile territory in his search for his parents, he is on a parallel journey of discovery - one of identity and belonging - as he attempts to find a safe house that is truly safe, a language that understands all languages, and a place in his soul that feels like home.""",,1770107665,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/1770107665.jpg

Dame Elsebet de Whellen has ruled her mildly magical, high-tech country for 50 prosperous years. Now it's facing a crisis three generations in the making, and the bold steps she's taken to save it have gone disastrously off the rails.
She needs a hero who can calm her mind, cast a spell, and find a missing sorcerer. Instead she gets Malfred Murd, former Royal Fool, booted from his job and now scrounging a living around the corners of the Kingdom. What starts as Fred's quick attempt to con Dame Elsebet escalates until he—and his self-appointed magpie advisor Corvinalias— are hopelessly entangled in a desperate mission that might cost a Fool his life and a people their future.",,9.78174E+12,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781735067902.jpg

Rocky II has hit the silver screen. The Knacks&#x2019; &#x2018;My Sherona&#x2019; and Donna Summer&#x2019;s &#x2018;Bad Girls&#x2019; are burning up the music charts and blasting in every disco on a Saturday night. Murder also dances to a timely final heartbeat. Human demise and carnage are running rampant, many last breaths taken beneath the concrete surface, hidden from the naked eye. The nasty truth lies in an underworld of vengeance, greed, and evil. Angelo Ferrari is an unrepentant, heartless man who lives his life in the shadows. As a gun for hire who has followed in his father&#x2019;s twisted footsteps, he has left a bloody trail of bodies in his wake. Since taking his first life at age fourteen, he has been holding a gun in one hand, a knife in the other, and hatred in his heart. He&#x2019;s so good at being wicked, he&#x2019;s never been caught red-handed. After years of grooming and experience, he is the newest Seraph of Mortality &#x2013; the executioner. One fateful evening, however, things change&#x2026;Andrea Ellison is an herbalist, palm reader, and Sensitive. She&#x2019;s also the wrong woman to cross.

Now it is home to a family whose unorthodox lives unfold into legend: Sweet Mother, an artist, her husband Shariff, a writer and soldier, and their children André and Max. From the moment his baby brother André is born, Max attaches himself to him, even dreaming the boy's homicidal dreams. When the wayward André later pulls free from the family to join a death cult, Max must decide how far he will be drawn into his brother's web. Serene and beautiful, Ladidi joins the family as a foster child, promising to marry the boy at school who can bring her a strawberry, a fruit she has never tasted. Sensuality blooms, along with loss of innocence amid the death of music legend Fela Kuti, massacres, disappearances, abductions and broken promises. While Sweet Mother and Shariff battle their personal demons, Max realises you cannot save your family. But can you ever escape them? In his exhilerating debut, TJ Benson conjures up a kaleidescope of Nigeria. This is the extraordinary tale of five people bound by blood, each searching for a way through.""--Page 4 of cover.",,1485904153,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/1485904153.jpg

Avery must discover Tobias’s secrets to understand why he chose her and to truly earn her place alongside the Hawthorne family. The question on everyone's minds… Why did Tobias Hawthorne, a billionaire Avery didn’t know, leave her his entire fortune? And Avery can’t simply inherit the fortune. She must play Tobias Hawthorne's last game. To earn her reward, she must go to Texas and live in the Hawthorne House for one year—along with Tobias’ four grandsons. Avery must work with the Hawthorne family to solve the game and find the truth. Avery must prove herself to the Hawthorne's as she tries to discover why Tobias left her everything. However, that might not be as easy as it seems.",,9.78137E+12,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781368052405.jpg

In 1978 Danny Novak, at thirteen, is hired to work at Camp Baker for the summer. He is the youngest boy on staff. Danny isn’t worried about his age. He’s confident he’ll fit right in, but quickly learns it’s not that easy. 
When Danny fails the swim test to work on the waterfront, Mark, the bad boy on staff, is forced to teach Danny to swim or get sent home. Home is the last place Mark wants to go, but he wants nothing to do with the skinny runt who’s ruined his summer. 
Even after Danny passes the test, he worries the other guys won’t accept him. 
On the Waterfront is a bittersweet coming of age tale of two boys struggling for acceptance and friendship.",,9.78174E+12,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781736602157.jpg

Her body has barely begun to heal; her mind feels broken. And her life is completely shattered: Three years ago, she and her younger brother, Abek, were the only members of their family to be sent to the right, away from the gas chambers of Auschwitz-Birkenau. Everyone else--her parents, her grandmother, radiant Aunt Maja--they went left.

Zofia's last words to her brother were a promise: Abek to Zofia, A to Z. When I find you again, we will fill our alphabet. Now her journey to fulfill that vow takes her through Poland and Germany, and into a displaced persons camp where everyone she meets is trying to piece together a future from a painful past: Miriam, desperately searching for the twin she was separated from after they survived medical experimentation. Breine, a former heiress, who now longs only for a simple wedding with her new fiancé. And Josef, who guards his past behind a wall of secrets, and is beautiful and strange and magnetic all at once.

But the deeper Zofia digs, the more impossible her search seems. How can she find one boy in a sea of the missing? In the rubble of a broken continent, Zofia must delve into a mystery whose answers could break her--or help her rebuild her world.",,9.78032E+12,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780316540445.jpg

The exhibition seeks to reinterpret Choi's oeuvre by focusing on the multilayered links between her art and literature, exemplified by her volumes of poetry and her interest in Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Despite being active in both Korea and the US as a painter, educator, and poet, Choi has been largely considered ""an American-style artist highly influenced by abstract expressionism"" or ""a tragic woman artist who died tragically young."" Wook-kyung Choi, Alice's Cat intends to examine the significance of her works in the context of Korean contemporary art by regarding them through the lens of their relationships with contemporary art and literature from various angles. At the same time, the exhibition will highlight both the active life of Choi, who never ceased to explore new worlds while moving between Korea and the US. Moreover, it will invite viewers to understand the contemporaneity of Choi's active life and creations as she ceaselessly explored new worlds in Korea and the U.S., similar to Alice as she embarked on an adventure into Wonderland out of pure curiosity""-- Exhibition website.",,8963032930,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/8963032930.jpg

As thoughts flash through her mind, Dawn braces herself for impact. The shocking thing is the thoughts are not of her husband but of a man she last saw fifteen years earlier. Miraculously, Dawn survives the crash, but so do all the doubts she suddenly feels. She has led a good life. Back in Boston, she has her husband, Brian, her beloved daughter, and her work as a death doula who helps to ease the transition between life and death for her clients. But somewhere in Egypt is Wyatt Armstrong, who works as an archaeologist unearthing ancient burial sites, a job she once studied for, but was forced to abandon. Now, when it seems that fate is offering her second chances, she is not as sure of the life choices she once made. After the crash, once they've been checked out by a doctor, the airline offers the passengers flights to a destination of their choice. The obvious thing for Dawn is to fly home, to her work, to her family. The other option that occurs to her, though, is to travel to the archaeological site she left years before, reconnect with Wyatt and their unresolved history, and maybe even complete her research on The Book of Two Ways--the first known map of the afterlife. As the story unfolds, Dawn's two futures unspool side by side, as do the secrets and doubts she's kept buried. And then there are the questions she's never truly asked: What does a well-lived life look like? When we leave the earth, what do we leave behind? Do we make choices or do our choices make us? And, who would you be, if you hadn't turned into the person you are right now?""--",,0735276900,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/0735276900.jpg

Her father brings her up to admire history&#x2019;s heroic male adventurers, while her mother channels her towards housework and conformity. But when puberty comes, paternal half-promises evaporate and Vega has to fight her own way out of the domestic cage. In a time of revolution and civil war in early twentieth-century Finland, she finds it hard to identify her own calling, alighting first on the cause of feminism but feeling her way towards a wider humanitarian mission. The adult Vega looks back on her younger self with ironic humour, but is in despair about the end of a rocky relationship with her beloved Ta, now transformed by his wartime experiences. She recovers and opts to emulate her childhood hero Livingstone, beating new paths through her own psychological jungle. A kaleidoscope of changing roles for Vega whirls us through this compelling modernist novel, multi-layered but eminently accessible, with a wonderful feel for language, and vibrant evocations of an era and a place. Considered by many to be Hagar Olsson&#x2019;s best novel, Chitambo is now available in English for the first time. --",,1909408557,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/1909408557.jpg

Her angelic power has only caused pain and despair to those she loves, and she is terrified of her own potential – as are the other angels.

Now the demonic hordes are an expanding plague, and the last six human nations are on the verge of collapse. Their only hope to escape extinction lies in Nyla and the untapped power within her.

When a nation harboring the few remaining angels calls for assistance, Nyla is thrust into the limelight. Joined by her guard and mentor Talivus, a soldier of the elite Fifth Legion of Dessedra, she travels the continent in search of allies against the demonic threat.

She discovers that the other angels hunt her, and her world crumbles. Allegiances falter, the moral compasses of the world’s leaders spin erratically, and devastation befalls her own life as she unlocks the gifts heaven has bestowed upon her.

Will she overcome her fears and save what little remains of humanity? If so, at what cost?",,9.79899E+12,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9798986621401.jpg

Kaylynn, Bertha, Janice, Laverne and Raquel try to navigate their way through domestic violence, migration, coming of age and the ever-cloying patriarchy that permeate every part of living in Eldorado Park, affectionately known as Eldos by its people. These women are at different ages and stages of their lives yet connected by this one place and a community that has shaped their worldview. Through phone calls, diary entries, poems and other forms of reported speech, each woman's struggles are told with honesty. Written, in part, from the perspective of Eldos, this predominantly Coloured township comes alive as the reader gets a look into the heart of a community that has been branded with the image of addiction and violence. The author's hope is to take the reader on a sensory experience that lays bare the sights, smells and soul of Eldos through the eyes of its residents and specifically these women characters. At its core, Those Who Live In Cages is a story about Coloured women, family, friendship, identity, and the many ways one can play the hand that life deals you.""--Publisher's description.",,1431430145,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/1431430145.jpg

Having returned to his birthplace in an attempt to get his career back on track, Henry struggles to complete a documentary he is working on. He whiles away his mornings swimming in a nearby tidal pool on Shark Island, and finds himself increasingly drawn to the small town and its romantic possibilities. But the tranquil land hides a bloody history: Shark Island was once the site of a concentration camp, and a law firm is suing the German government for their role in the genocide of Namibia's indigenous people. When Henry begins to interview the survivors' descendants, their testimonies compel him to search the desert for a mass grave. At the Edge of the Desert  is a meditation on loss, isolation and love, which asks us to consider the implications of telling someone else's story.""--Page 4 of cover.",,1485904099,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/1485904099.jpg

Lazer's series of poems hold outrage and peace, anger and momentary joy within a shared space.

Her family is miles away. Her ex-husband is remarried. Her son is off to college. With an early mid-life crisis looming, Becky is at a crossroads: keep working dead-end jobs to survive, or take a leap of faith. During a visit home, she stumbles across the abandoned one-room schoolhouse where she played as a child and had her first kiss a teenager. With her family's encouragement, Becky decides to stay in town and find a way to save the historic building from demolition. As she works on her business plan, Becky begins to reconnect with her past. Her best friend, Maggie, is three kids deep into a dysfunctional marriage. The grandparents who raised Becky have aged exponentially, and her beloved grandfather is ill. Still, Becky finds herself enchanted by the small southern community where she was raised.

Speed and self-confidence, that's Astrid's motto. Nicknamed ""the little thunderbolt,"" she loves to spend her days racing down the hillside on her sled, singing loudly as she goes, and visiting Gunnvald, her grumpy, septuagenarian best friend and godfather, who makes hot chocolate from real chocolate bars. She just wishes there were other children to share her hair-raising adventures with. But Astrid's world is about to be turned upside down by two startling arrivals to the village of Glimmerdal: first a new family, then a mysterious, towering woman who everyone seems to know but Astrid. It turns out that Gunnvald has been keeping a big secret from his goddaughter, one that will test their friendship to its limits. Astrid is not too happy about some of these upheavals in Glimmerdal -- but, luckily, she has a plan to set things right.",,1536213225,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/1536213225.jpg

Has Louw been in an accident? Is she having an affair? Has she been hijacked, assaulted, or worse, left for dead in the bushes and sand dunes of the Cape Flats? Or has it got something to do with their argument that morning? Then news breaks of a murdered man found in a Cape hotel - the same hotel Louw was last seen in, on the same night. And it's the very man who was the speaker at her work function. Was Louw involved in the murder? Is she on the run? That's what the police say. Or is there a connection to her mother's hijacking 21 years ago, an event which left Louw psychologically scarred? Amid all these questions and a rising sense of dread, Kristien knows Louw is in trouble, and she needs her help.""",,1485904447,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/1485904447.jpg

Inspired by her own adventurous, unconventional life, actress and writer Goliarda Sapienza's recently rediscovered novel takes the reader to the sun-drenched town of Positano in southern Italy. There, while working on a film, Goliarda encounters the captivating Erica, a beautiful widow called ""Princess"" by the locals, who has been the object of much speculation. As the two women grow closer in spite of their different personalities, they gradually reveal more about their thoughts, feelings, and experiences, and the ghosts from their pasts that continue to hang over them. Writing the story of this transformative friendship thirty years later, Goliarda offers a profound reflection on love in its many forms, and opens a window onto an enchanting time and place that lingers in the mind.""--",,9.78164E+12,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781635420449.jpg

Yet despite its popularity in Turkey, and increasing recognition abroad, Ümit's fiction has seldom been subject to scholarly inquiry. Adopting the framework of cultural narratology, Nation and Identity in Turkish Crime Fiction provides the most comprehensive analysis to date of Ahmet Ümit's crime novels, seeking thereby to fill a gap, and also to widen our understanding of the politics of the Turkish novel by extending the focus of literary and cultural criticism to include the field of contemporary popular literature.Through a consideration of the transformations and changing dynamics that have marked Turkish culture and politics over the last two decades, Zeynep Tüfekçioglu conceptualizes Ümit's fiction as a medium of ideological negotiation. The study unveils the significance of the various narrative techniques, literary tropes and themes found in Ümit?s fiction, which he employs to contest dominant discourses of national identity, history, and cultural memory. Tüfekçioglu shows that since his early novels, Ahmet Ümit has been following and adopting the global trends in the genre, while also appropriating and subverting them for the purposes of cultural resistance. As such, this book will appeal to scholars of Turkish literary and cultural studies, as well as to scholars and devoted readers of crime fiction.",,3447115785,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/3447115785.jpg

As her daughter Thato grows, she begins to develop otherworldly powers ranging from visions, to seeing the dead, to healing by touch. A young pastor, Solomon Khumalo, is desperate to prove himself by preaching the word of God to a large and loyal congregation. When he discovers Thato's powers, he makes Mamokgethi a tempting offer: in exchange for money, he would pass off Thato's healing powers as his own. As the pastor's popularity and thirst for power grows, Thato finds herself increasingly haunted by the past. The ripples of a family tragedy that happened in the family 30 years ago, creates a burden on her young shoulders as she tries to solve it. The Invisible Strings is a story about the past bleeding into the present, the living and the dead, and the scourge of charismatic pastors.""--Goodreads description.",,192070373X,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/192070373X.jpg

The novel was inspired by a reader, who, after reading my first book titled Dry Tears, which focuses on problems faced by women in patriarchal societies, challenged me to write a book exploring some of the issues that men are confronted with, in their everyday lives. The setting of the book is between a village and a township, with the main character caught in-between balancing his life using his experience of having lived in both settings. Beyond The Beard also seeks to preach the gospel of togetherness, selflessness and respect.  It is also from the same book that we learn about the importance of forgiveness and not holding a grudge. It is mostly said that people who love one another do not dwellon each other's mistakes. Through this book, may the spirit of apologising and forgiving be entrenched even further. No one is rich enough to do without a neighbour. In this world infested with high levels of gender-based violence and femicide incidents, may this novel be one of the catalysts for peace! Lastly, enjoy, to the fullest, the African proverbs, traditions and stories invoked in this piece of literature."" -- Publisher's descrition.",,0620884444,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/0620884444.jpg

This intriguing tale begins with murder and ends with murder. In a frightening twist of fate, Saduj, a young orphan, unwittingly gets caught up in the surreal and sinister Marcos dictatorship. Through his narration we follow the formidable rise of an elite student to president and eventual pariah. Privy to the inner dealings of both Ferdinand and Imelda, Saduj is at first flattered and proud to be such a close confidante of the president, but slowly over time he witnesses the true suffering caused by the barbaric regime. As it slowly dawns on him that he has been hoodwinked into some outlandish fairy tale, so does the chilling reality that he is now a target. With his own life in danger both within the palace walls and on the outside, and the dictatorship about to implode, can he survive long enough to find a way out? Although a work of fiction, the novel is based on true events, and in particular on one exceptional man, destined for greatness but only to end up diseased by power and greed whilst ably abetted by his duplicitous wife.",,9715429386,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9715429386.jpg

Ten-year-old Sera is isolated and depressed; bullied at school and at home by her father. Her mind gives her no respite, suffering from a panic disorder and a second voice in her head that forces violent, intrusive thoughts.

She meets the fallen angel Byleth one night while wanting to end her life. He isn't a fan of kids and intends to leave immediately, but Sera's aura catches his eye. It's dark, and it isn't from her trauma that pulls at his heartstrings. It's also attracted a corrupt angel who wants to rid the world of another Hellspawn child.

Sera has a lot on her plate, but as she ages and transitions to Sean, a disabled trans man with C-PTSD, he not only meets more spirit guides from Hell, he realizes that his biggest threat has always been the 'other' that dwells in his own head.",,9.79899E+12,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9798989082414.jpg

There Robert and his younger sibling, Emily, find themselves strangers in new schools and without friends. However, things change quickly, and Robert excels in sports and popularity. He befriends Roger LeBlanc, a football team member. Emily and Roger’s younger sister, Coralie, also become fast friends.

Robert Bryant harbors a secret: he was born a genius but also exhibited exceptional coordination, which is a rarity. Those traits and his physical appearance make him attractive to the girls at his school. But those same characteristics cause Robert to struggle with the concept of love. He only maintains short, casual relationships with young ladies as he grows

Years later, Robert finds the passion of love where he least expected, but things change suddenly. Then, Robert Bryant is propelled into a world of betrayal, deceit, and treachery as he struggles to reunite with his one true love. Along the way, Robert discovers a dark past and things about himself, which accounts for how he became the way he is
 
What begins as a coming-of-age story of adolescents becomes so much more in this book, with twists and turns abound. Will Robert reunite with the love of his life or forfeit true love forever?",,9.79822E+12,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9798218128524.jpg

With the help of Byleth, Zagan, and Darokin, he thinks his troubles are finally behind him. Little does he know that PTSD is a beast lying dormant in waiting to emerge. It ends up influencing everything, including the way he perceives reality.

Vexis was the reason Sean remained in a trauma loop for so long, but something changes within them as they decide to finally work with him; they want to help him heal from trauma after years of prolonging it. Being a sadist who is unable to feel love, it results in a twisted and sexual masochistic relationship that Sean becomes addicted to.

As Vexis takes Sean through various liminal space voids and dark memories — theirs included — they reveal that they are something much more frightening and ancient than an angel or a demon.

Can Vexis really be trusted? Or are they opening Sean's wounds to let something sinister slip inside...",,9.79899E+12,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9798989082407.jpg

It's the very real inheritance she stands to gain if she follows the stipulations in her grandfather's will when she takes over his family practice. The only problem? The stipulations mean a life she doesn't want. Terri Anderson knows better than to get involved with her resident. She's had a work romance before--it didn't end well and she doesn't want to be part of the gossip mill all over again. But with Sam, keeping her distance is easier said than done. When Sam considers walking away from medicine, Terri knows she can't let her make that huge mistake. But changing Sam's mind means getting close.

A populist politician is gunned down outside parliament. His number two executed in bed with a high-class escort. A cabinet minister shot leaving a security estate. A cop assassinated in his car. Another in his beach house. And it all ties back to the murder of Swedish prime minister Olof Palme in 1986 - as private investigator Fish Pescado is about to discover. He's on the case, hunting a rogue agent through industrial estates, retirement homes, a farm in the Moordenaars Karoo. He's also convinced someone's out to kill his lover Vicki Kahn, lying in a coma in hospital.

When the body of a third woman is pulled out of the Vaal River, south of Joburg,,Captain Reshma Patel starts to wonder if a serial killer is at work - or if the mutilated corpses have anything to do with the spate of cash-in-transit heists she's busy investigating. When a fourth woman goes missing Reshma and her partner, former police officer Ian Jack, have to figure out who is behind the killings-- and to stop them, before they can strike again. -- Publisher's description.",,1770107029,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/1770107029.jpg

Exploring the works of Christina Rossetti, Coventry Patmore, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Adelaide Anne Procter, Alice Meynell and Alfred, Lord Tennyson, Lesa Scholl examines the extent to which these poets - not all of whom were Anglo-Catholics themselves - engaged with the Tractarian social vision when grappling with issues of poverty and economic injustice in and beyond their poetic works. By engaging with economic and cultural history, as well as the sensorial materiality of poetry, Hunger, Poetry and the Oxford Movement challenges the assumption that High-Church politics were essentially conservative and removed from the social crises of the Victorian period.""--",,9.78135E+12,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781350120723.jpg

There are few leads to go on, and the gang always seems to be a step ahead of the cops, raising suspicions of a leak from the inside. Andile Xaba lives a double life, leading a crew of heist men and hiding his activities from his girlfriend and mother. He knows the police are on his tail, and when a job goes wrong, fault lines start emerging in the gang. They cannot afford any more mistakes. In this explosive new crime thriller, Andrew Brown pits his haunted detective against the most elusive enemy he has yet faced. While dealing with his own demons, problems with his ex-wife and daughter, and a colonel with a history in the apartheid police force, Eberard moves ever closer to a dramatic showdown.""--",,177609672X,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/177609672X.jpg

The domestic abuse she suffered may be labeled textbook by therapists, but it's the parts she's never told anyone that haunt her. She refuses to get rapped in that hell ever again. Former Special Forces soldier turned rancher Noah Dempsey is more than capable of training the delicate single mom in moves and tactics that will help her feel safe. But his own tortured past makes him decidedly less qualified for anything more. No matter how much her big eyes--and even bigger heart--draw him in. However, when unexpected danger arrives in their small town, Noah knows this is a woman worth fighting for. Worth fighting beside. And he's going to be the one to do it. She needs a hero. He'll have to remember how to be one.",,1643842463,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/1643842463.jpg

It recounts the tragic and moving story of a young Jewish teenager faced with the horrors of Nazism. In it, Anne establishes a bond with her readers that transcends both time and space, making them her friends and confidants. Readers feel a connection with each dream she had, each fear she endured, and each struggle she confronted. Her diary ended, but her story did not. The Lost Diary of Anne Frank picks up where her original journal left off, taking the reader on a credible journey through the tragic final months of her life, faithfully adhering to her own, very personal, diary format in the process. In The Lost Diary of Anne Frank, Anne receives mysterious help from many quarters. A strange lady on the other side of the fence haunts her dreams. Her sister falls in love with a Nazi guard. Her mom, once vilified, becomes a hero. Anne struggles with the existence of God and His presence or absence in all of her ordeals. She contrasts the depravity of man with what she sees as mankind's evident virtues. Her longing to experience sensual pleasures is numbed by forced over-exposure. She finds that in the Nazi efforts to extinguish the humanity of their victims, a chorus of unity evolves among the captives. Anne's vaulted dreams for fame and notice are ultimately traded in for the true longings of life, love, and peace. The Lost Diary of Anne Frank follows her story to the chilling end.",,9.78159E+12,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781592110551.jpg

Sick and abandoned by his wife and son, Oséias decides to go back to his hometown after twenty years away. During this time apart, he has heard about his family only through sporadic phone calls from his younger sister, Isabela. The shadow of the suicide of their sister Lígia, when she was fifteen, lingers over Oséias as he tries to reestablish contact with his siblings. Each of them is absorbed in their own world: Rosana and her obsession with fitness; Isabela and her struggle to survive; João Lúcio and his isolation. All of them are branded by loneliness, but most of all Oséias, who, misunderstood by his family members and old acquaintances, decides to put an end to his journey. Late Summer can be read as both the realistic story of a displaced man tortured by his unsuccessful attempt to redeem his past, and as a portrait of contemporary society, in which social classes have ruptured any form of dialogue between them, and people have become rogue planets whose paths cross occasionally, risking mutual destruction.""--",,9.78164E+12,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781635420210.jpg

On a winter night in Paris, a young woman is pulled naked out of the Seine. She has amnesia and bears no identifying marks apart from two peculiar tattoos. She is rushed to the infirmary of Paris police headquarters, but only a few hours later, she disappears.
 
DNA analysis reveals her identity. She is the famous pianist Milena Bergman. But that’s impossible, because Milena died in a plane crash more than a year ago. Raphael, Milena’s former fiancé desperate for answers, and Roxane, a cop hell-bent on proving herself after a recent fall from grace, spearhead the investigation. Their quest to uncover the truth quickly reveals secrets long buried, a web of impostors, and danger lurking in plain sight. Nevertheless, they are determined to get to the center of this mystery: How can a person be both dead and alive at the same time?",,9.78032E+12,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780316497404.jpg

As a little girl, her grandfather put a stick and a shield in her hands and taught her the ancient stick-fighting art of her Zulu ancestors. The hard way. And right now she is in a hard place, searching for Drew, her young son - kidnapped and drawn into the heart of a vicious gang conflict. Ex-army and ex-cop, Clementine has tracked Drew's phone to Welcome Shade - a sprawling retirement estate that has fallen into disrepair to become a gang-infested war-zone. With nothing but a talent for violence, a drone piloted by a skinny Afrikaans street kid as her eye-in-the-sky, and a huge dog with ptsd who tried to kill her and then, somehow, became her sidekick, she'll wield stick and shield, machete and shotgun, and wade through a sea of bodies to find her son. But the gangs are only part of the problem. Dark, twisted things stalk the estate: nightmare creatures, elite military snipers working as mercenaries and a sword-wielding man on a white horse who has made her and Drew part of his agenda. And then there are the memories and visions of her ancestors, and her own very special hallucination whom she nicknames 'Glitch'. It's going to be a hard day.""--",,1485904501,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/1485904501.jpg

From the beginning, our community has had many talented storytellers who have passed down history, folktales, and the experiences of our people, paving the way for each generation that followed. Two Times Removed brings together a curated collection of sixteen short stories written by the new generation of Indo-Caribbean storytellers. For many of us who have been raised outside of our home countries, our identity is a delicate balance of Indian roots, Caribbean heritage and North American upbringing. Together, these writers explore adolescence, relationships, trauma, family, identity and more, bringing to life the experiences of the modern day Indo-Caribbean. Each character, as we do, navigates their world with the influences of all these elements, making them uniquely Two Times Removed.

He is taken in by a sculptor who sees in him the perfect model for her Christ, although her real masterwork will be a larger-than-life Virgin. But the Church will come to reject this sisterhood of unmarried women on the island, and they are bound to lose their small freedoms. Centuries later, a lieutenant is sent to an island to dispose of unexploded ordnance. As an erstwhile World War ii flight nurse trained to evacuate wounded soldiers, she too has gazed upon, and been haunted by, the bodies of broken young men. For her, a fraught love affair with a local man will ignite, while his teenage daughter looks on. Binding the lives - so different and so similar - of women separated by time and place, Claire Robertson's Isle  is an all-encompassing rumination on privacy, inhibition and female desire, rendered in her masterful prose""--Provided by Publisher.",,1415210640,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/1415210640.jpg

Written and directed by Cole Power's son, the thriller promises to entice audiences with its sultry storyline and intimately connected cast. Three very different women arrive on set, each with her own motive. Stella, an infamously unstable actress, is struggling to reclaim the career she lost in the wake of multiple, very public breakdowns. Taylor, a fledgling producer, is anxious to work on a film she hopes will turn her career around after her last job ended in scandal. And Felicity, Stella's mysterious new assistant, harbors designs of her own that threaten to upend all their plans. With a hurricane brewing offshore, each woman finds herself trapped on the island, united against a common enemy. But as deceptions come to light, misplaced trust may prove more perilous than the storm itself.""--Provided by publisher.",,9.78154E+12,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781538733660.jpg

This novel is a story of the consequences of the 1979 Islamic Revolution of Iran and the subsequent Iran-Iraq War, the longest war in the twentieth century, with its tremendous destructive results on the lives of virtually all Iranians. In the wake of that revolution and during that war, initially, thousands and eventually millions of Iranians fled the country, often leaving behind their kith and kin and all they possessed without knowing where they would find refuge away from all the mayhem and destruction. The narrator/protagonist of THE LAST DREAM, of course, does not tell us directly that her escape from Iran was the consequence of the revolution and the war, and instead she states a different tragic event as the cause of her flight from her beloved country. Readers of this novel, however, in particular Iranian readers, would identify the protagonist's reason for her flight and experiencing several years of danger and hardship before she arrives at her destination to be none other than the political and social devastation of her hearth and home""--",,1568593813,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/1568593813.jpg

Joburg the city meets Noir the genre, and the pair are made for each other. 'In noir the problem is not an individual: the problem is the world. Institutions are corrupt, public moralities hypocritical, the watchmen un-watched. No one gets away clean' (Seely, 2016). Sound familiar? Welcome to Joburg Noir. While the stories allow the reader to layer their experience of current Johannesburg with the traces, memories and experiences of these writers, they also provide a weapon against entrenched and invisible systems of power and privilege and a haven for seldom heard, angry voices; voices that seek to reveal the city space by displaying its complex dynamics. Do they succeed? Perhaps, but at least they are the ones who can look Joburg in the face without flinching. Edited and compiled by the inimitable Niq Mhlongo - no stranger to the world of publishing with three novels, two collections of short stories, and the editor of a bestselling collection of essays, Black Tax, Burden or Ubuntu?, to his name - this collection showcases the depth of black writing talent in South Africa. It illustrates how a publication of this nature, which breaks with tradition and grows the talent pool, adds more than just another publication to the bookshop shelves.""--Page 4 of cover.",,1431430242,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/1431430242.jpg

For most people, World War Two has been over for six years, but it’s still a brutal reality for Leni Mayer, brought to Buenos Aires by a Nazi who took her captive in 1940 and never let her go. Lonely and despairing, she longs for a chance to return to England and be herself again.

Butterfly enthusiast Raymond Varela and his eight-year-old son Anton have come to Patagonia in an effort to start life afresh after the losses of the war years. Haunted by the death of his wife in a bombing raid in 1943, Raymond longs to let the peaceful wilderness heal him, but instead he faces chaos when a runaway Leni intrudes into their expedition.

As the months pass, Raymond and Leni’s perceptions of one another begin to shift, but the strength of their feelings will be tested when they return to Buenos Aires, where danger lurks around every corner, and sunshiny Anton, who brought them together, may be the very thing that drives them apart.",,9.78174E+12,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781736029756.jpg

In this sweeping story, at once epic and startlingly intimate, Shyam Selvadurai introduces us to Siddhartha Gautama, otherwise known as the Buddha, a promising and politically astute young man settling into his life as a newlywed to Yasodhara, a young woman of great intelligence and spirit. The novel traces their early life together, and then the unthinkable turmoil as Siddhartha's spiritual calling takes over and their partnership slowly, inexorably crumbles. How does a woman live in ancient India if her husband abandons her? Even a well-born woman with a revered husband? And what path might she take towards enlightenment herself? Selvadurai examines these questions with empathy and insight, creating a rich, strikingly relevant portrait of a singular marriage, and of the woman who until now has been a shadow in the historical record. Mansions of the Moon is a literary event, and a remarkable moment in a beloved author's career.""--",,0735280622,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/0735280622.jpg

""A Hundred Sweet Promises"" is the tale of the author's grandfather, Nasrosoltan, a famed composer, who on the eve of World War I travels from Persia to Russia to study classical music at the St. Petersburg Conservatory with such masters as Rimsky-Korsakov.

After a series of racial traumas, Vanessa obtains the birth certificate of a deceased white baby and uses this document to assume the child's identity. She moves to California and enrolls at UC Berkeley under her newly acquired name.
Vanessa marries into one of California's wealthiest families. Her charmed life abruptly ends eighteen months after the birth of her first child who is diagnosed with sickle cell trait. Discovering that the woman he married is Black, as is his toddler son, Vanessa's ruthless husband plots his revenge but they both survive. The police investigation that follows seems pretty clear-cut until a curious, young detective uncovers some clues to her private life where nothing is as it appears.

Kennedy said he needed sex every three days or he got a headache. In the White House, he never had a headache. Kennedy met Mary Pinchot in 1935, when he was eighteen and she was sixteen. Twenty years later, when she was living in Virginia and married to Cord Meyer, a high-ranking CIA official, she was Jack and Jackie Kennedy's next-door neighbor. In 1962, she was an artist, divorced, living in Washington--and Kennedy's first serious romance. Mary Pinchot Meyer was more than a bedmate. She was Kennedy's beacon light: his sole female adviser, spending mornings in the Oval Office, and, at night, discussing issues. After the 1964 election, Kennedy said, he would divorce Jackie and marry her.",,9.78151E+12,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781510759152.jpg

Growing up as the son of a petrol-station owner in a Lowveld town, twelve-year-old Max is bashed around and bullied - until the arrival of Karl Udengaard. Karl teaches Max how to toughen up, while Max's feelings for Gunna Udengaard, Karl's enigmatic mother, rage in secret. Tragedy severs Max's ties with the wealthy Udengaards. As the decades-old memories unravel, he begins to comprehend his own complicity in his and their misfortunes. Due South of Copenhagen is a masterful tale of the scope of intimate connections between people, small-town living during the height of South Africa's Border War, and what it takes to put the past to rest.""--Back cover",,1415210470,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/1415210470.jpg

There, he meets an assortment of characters, his fellow patients, and narrates their hilarious, horrific and ultimately tragic stories as relayed to him by themselves. His conflicted feelings about being in the treatment facility, and keen curiosity with regard to the admission stories of his fellow patients, serve as the unfolding plot for his stay in the Psychiatric Ward. The protagonist agonises about what it means, to be adjudged mentally unwell, by a society whose very foundations seem to him unjust and unhealthy to the point of being bizarre.

Like everyone else, he feels unmoored by the end of the conflict. War had given him his sense of purpose, his identity. But why has Emil's life turned out so different from his parents', who spent cheery Friday evenings flapping and flailing the Charleston or dancing the foxtrot? What happened to the Emil who used to wade through the singing elephant grass of the savannah, losing himself in it? Prize-winning novelist Siphiwe Gloria Ndlovu traces Emil's life from boyhood to manhood - from his days at a privileged boarding school with the motto 'It is here that boys become the men of history', to his falling in love with the ever-elusive Marion, whose free-spirited nature has dire consequences for his heart - all the while showing how Emil becomes a man apart. Set in a southern African country that is never named, this powerful tale of human fallibility - told with empathy, generosity and a light touch - is an excursion into the interiority of the coloniser.""--Back cover.",,1485904218,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/1485904218.jpg

But when life delivered blow after devastating blow, Yasmen and Josiah Wade found that love alone couldn’t solve or save everything.

It couldn’t save their marriage.

Yasmen wasn’t prepared for how her life fell apart, but she’s is finally starting to find joy again. She and Josiah have found a new rhythm, co-parenting their two kids and running a thriving business together. Yet like magnets, they’re always drawn back to each other, and now they’re beginning to wonder if they’re truly ready to let go of everything they once had.

Soon, one stolen kiss leads to another…and then more. It's hot. It's illicit. It's all good—until old wounds reopen. Is it too late for them to find forever? Or could they even be better, the second time around?",,1538706814,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/1538706814.jpg

Her angelic power has only caused pain and despair to those she loves, and she is terrified of her own potential – as are the other angels.

Now the demonic hordes are an expanding plague, and the last six human nations are on the verge of collapse. Their only hope to escape extinction lies in Nyla and the untapped power within her.

When a nation harboring the few remaining angels calls for assistance, Nyla is thrust into the limelight. Joined by her guard and mentor Talivus, a soldier of the elite Fifth Legion of Dessedra, she travels the continent in search of allies against the demonic threat.

She discovers that the other angels hunt her, and her world crumbles. Allegiances falter, the moral compasses of the world’s leaders spin erratically, and devastation befalls her own life as she unlocks the gifts heaven has bestowed upon her.

Will she overcome her fears and save what little remains of humanity? If so, at what cost?",,9.79899E+12,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9798986621401.jpg

Told through the lives and spirits of four generations of amaTolo women, including The Old, who speak wisdom with ever-increasing urgency, it moves between the bustling township setting of Kwanele and the different rhythms of rural village life. It recalls the sweeping sagas of the great A.C. Jordan and the Dhlomo brothers and invokes the poetry of S.E.K. Mqhayi, while boldly exploring urgent and contemporary issues. An ode to the complex strengths of South African women, When The Village Sleeps is also a powerful call to respect the earth that nurtures human life, and to live in self-sufficiency and harmony with the environment.""--",,1770106294,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/1770106294.jpg

He has embalmed countless corpses, unpacked organs, reset bones and made up pallid faces for their final viewing.

It looks like another humdrum day at White Lily Funerals when Seb meets Gabe, a dying boy unusually interested in caskets, who forces the mortician to rearrange the pieces of his life and shows him that magic doesn’t have to be just a wish.""--Back cover.",,1988595282,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/1988595282.jpg

He desperately wants to know what it’s like and why it seems so easy for everyone but him to find someone. What’s worse is that, even though he is proud of his identity, Felix also secretly fears that he’s one marginalization too many—Black, queer, and transgender—to ever get his own happily-ever-after.

When an anonymous student begins sending him transphobic messages—after publicly posting Felix’s deadname alongside images of him before he transitioned—Felix comes up with a plan for revenge. What he didn’t count on: his catfish scenario landing him in a quasi–love triangle....

But as he navigates his complicated feelings, Felix begins a journey of questioning and self-discovery that helps redefine his most important relationship: how he feels about himself.",,1432888919,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/1432888919.jpg

In An Unspecific Dog, Joshua Rothes collects 150 short texts as fables for our time, a veritable catalog of agnotology, a series of situations and propositions that revel in the dark irony at the root of our early-twenty-first-century existence.  A man reads the terms and conditions and finds that he has no secrets, while scientists promise that, ?with improvements to fMRI technology, what matters to us will become more clear.?  The subjects of these texts are caught between vocabularies, between contingency and certainty, the interim in which certain kind of ironic vitality exists, where tragedy and humor are equally likely and often deeply entangled. Rothes reminds us that language acts as a mirror for human experience, in that through it we can never really see the backs of our own heads.",,9.781E+12,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780998531816.jpg

A local schoolteacher is found taped to a tree and stoned to death. Suspicion instantly falls on the refugees at the new detention centre on Cobb's northern outskirts. Tensions are high, between whites and the local indigenous community, between immigrants and the townies. Still mourning the recent death of his father, Detective Sergeant George Manolis returns to his childhood hometown to investigate. Within minutes of his arrival, it's clear that Cobb is not the same place he left. Once it thrived, but now it's a poor and derelict dust hole, with the local police chief it deserves. And as Manolis negotiates his new colleagues' antagonism, and the simmering anger of a community destroyed by alcohol and drugs, the ghosts of his past begin to flicker to life.",,1925760790,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/1925760790.jpg

The character appears in only two scenes and has no dialogue. However, Vavachan's performance, and his moustache, terrify the mostly upper-caste audience, reviving in them memories of characters of Dalit power, such as Ravanan. Afterwards, Vavachan, whose people were traditionally banned from growing facial hair, refuses to shave off his moustache. Endless tales invent and reinvent the legend of his magic moustache in which birds roost, which allows its owner to appear simultaneously in different places and disappear in an instant, which grows as high as the sky and as thick as rainclouds and turn Vavachan into Moustache, a figure of mythic proportions. Set in Kuttanad, a below-sea-level farming region on the south-west coast of Kerala, the novel is as much a story of this land as it is of Vavachan and its other inhabitants. As they navigate the intricate waterscape, stories unfold in which ecology, power dynamics and politics become key themes. Originally published in Malayalam as Meesha, S. Hareesh's Moustache is a contemporary classic mixing magic, myth and metaphor into a tale of far-reaching resonance. """,,9353576024,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9353576024.jpg

As a young naval officer, he sees his ship sunk under him at Dunkirk, an event that leaves him defeated. After recovering in London, Jack sails for South Africa to join his admiral father at the Cape where a fledgling naval force is preparing to fight the coming onslaught of German raiders and u-boats in the South Atlantic. Jack is appointed commander of a small minesweeping flotilla - an inept bunch of South African sailors who distrust this foreign captain forced upon them - and must quickly mould them into a fighting unit. Meanwhile a Nazi commerce raider, a powerful warship disguised as a neutral merchant ship, has left Germany for the Cape, intending to wreak havoc on Allied shipping. Jack and his flotilla will be pushed to the limit - and beyond. A sweeping historical adventure, The Cape Raider is the tale of a broken hero who has to find himself despite the trauma of war, a domineering father and the death of his mother during the Blitz. He must adapt to a new country, a new navy and new love, and finally he must come face to face with the Nazi raider in a fight to the death in the icy seas off the southernmost tip of Africa."" --",,1485904420,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/1485904420.jpg

At the start of her second year at university she is thrust into the volatile terrain of feminist activism. A storm of prejudice and abuse breaks around her when a first-year student is sexually molested during orientation week. Later, a female student involved in a turbulent relationship is murdered. Although embroiled in her own youthful emotional turmoil, Moja becomes a fighter against the patriarchy that had reigned for generations. Her rise to the presidency of the Students Representative Council at her university gives her the power to build a pedestal of hope for young women to stand on.

Through hard work and a fair amount of luck, he owns an estate, and his horses are renowned throughout Somerset. But he wants them to be coveted throughout England and that requires the endorsement of a well-respected duke. Philip will not allow anything to distract him. That is until he meets a governess attending his neighbor's house party. His attraction to her is strong and immediate, but she cannot seem to see him as anything more than a groom. As the daughter of a viscount, Elizabeth Carter never thought she would be a spinster, or have to seek employment as a governess. When she attends a house party with the children of her employer, she is immediately drawn to the owner of the neighboring estate. But the man is nothing like what she dreamed. He seems more at home in the stables than in the parlor. When a duke makes Elizabeth an offer, she knows she must seize the opportunity with both hands. But accepting the offer does not stop her from thinking of Mr. Jenkins. As the house party draws to a close, both Philip and Elizabeth must decide what is more important--the security they always dreamed of or the love they just discovered.",,9.78195E+12,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781953054081.jpg

After her life is upended by divorce and a cross-country move, 16-year-old Saskia Brown feels like an outsider at her new school—not only is she a transplant, but she’s also biracial in a population of mostly white students. One day while visiting her only friend at her part-time library job, Saskia encounters a vial of liquid mercury, then touches an old daguerreotype—the precursor of the modern-day photograph—and makes a startling discovery. She is somehow able to visit the man in the portrait: Robert Cornelius, a brilliant young inventor from the nineteenth century. The hitch: she can see him only in her dreams.
 
Saskia shares her revelation with some classmates, hoping to find connection and friendship among strangers. Under her guidance, the other girls steal portraits of young men from a local college’s daguerreotype collection and try the dangerous experiment for themselves. Soon, they each form a bond with their own “Mercury Boy,” from an injured Union soldier to a charming pickpocket in New York City.
 
At night, the girls visit the boys in their dreams. During the day, they hold clandestine meetings of their new secret society. At first, the Mercury Boys Club is a thrilling diversion from their troubled everyday lives, but it’s not long before jealousy, violence and secrets threaten everything the girls hold dear.",,9.78164E+12,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781641292658.jpg

A sequel to her earlier novel, THE LAST DREAM, this novel explores the psychological dilemma of Iranian immigrants, a dilemma with which the first generation grapples but seems ultimately unable to resolve. In THE LAST DREAM, that dilemma is expressed in such reflective passages as the following: But for Arya and her generation, the game was a bit different. The memories in the middle of which half of their lives revolved and were a part of their daily lives undoubtedly always had a place in their conversations, in their sleep and wakefulness, and in their friendships and social circles. Their accent became less noticeable every day, but it would not go away. All these things were a reminder that they belonged somewhere else, a place to which they also did not belong any longer. Sharifian's insight into the dilemma of Iranian immigrants, the sense of not fully belonging to the country and culture of either land, can be extended to most if not virtually all transplanted people around the world. This novel is a thoughtful exploration of this global phenomenon""--",,1568593821,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/1568593821.jpg

Shanti, a bright teenager stifled by life in rural India and facing an arranged marriage, dreams that South Africa is an opportunity to start afresh. The Colony of Natal is where Shanti believes she can escape the poverty, caste, and troubling fate of young girls in her village. Months later, after a harrowing sea voyage, she arrives in Natal only to discover the profound hardship and slave labour that await her.  Spanning four decades and two continents, Children of Sugarcane demonstrates the lifegiving power of love, heartache, and the indestructible bonds between family and friends. These bonds prompt heroism and sacrifice, the final act of which leads to Shanti's redemption. "" --",,1776191714,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/1776191714.jpg

A romance writer who no longer believes in love and a literary writer stuck in a rut engage in a summer-long challenge that may just upend everything they believe about happily ever afters.

Augustus Everett is an acclaimed author of literary fiction. January Andrews writes bestselling romance. When she pens a happily ever after, he kills off his entire cast.

They’re polar opposites.

In fact, the only thing they have in common is that for the next three months, they're living in neighboring beach houses, broke, and bogged down with writer's block.

Until, one hazy evening, one thing leads to another and they strike a deal designed to force them out of their creative ruts: Augustus will spend the summer writing something happy, and January will pen the next Great American Novel. She’ll take him on field trips worthy of any rom-com montage, and he’ll take her to interview surviving members of a backwoods death cult (obviously). Everyone will finish a book and no one will fall in love. Really.",,9.78024E+12,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780241989524.jpg

She barely got out alive, carrying her deepest secrets of love and tragedy. Nilufar had arrived in Tehran in November 1979 to take a job as a junior American diplomat at the U.S. Embassy. She had instead spent nine years as an American spy, reporting from deep inside the new Islamic Republic as it collapsed into extremism, civil strife, and war. After her return to America, she chose a quiet university life and swore she would never again do Washington's bidding. Her tranquility is upended by a plea from Alan Porter, the man who had sent her to Tehran in 1979. Porter tells her about a plot by colluding American and Iranian extremists to provoke a war between the two countries. He says she is the only person who can stop it. Nilufar is reluctant to go back to Iran, vividly recalling the agony of her years under cover, when she posed as a believer, the devout and revolutionary ""Massoumeh"". She can never forget the horrific end to her mission when her lover and the father of her unborn child were murdered. A commitment to serve the United States, which never died inside her, propels her back into the maelstrom. Nilufar adopts another covert identity and returns to Iran to end the parallel conspiracies intent on sparking a conflict. While she is working in Tehran, Porter must stop the Americans ready to promote their private agendas through mass murder. Nilufar must evade Iran's vicious secret police, deliver a message from America, convince a patriotic but suspicious group of Iranians to act, and once more manage a narrow escape from both Iran and her own memories""--",,1568593805,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/1568593805.jpg

But when his mother, Emma, a celebrated sculptor, takes them all on a family holiday to a hotel by the sea, he meets the captivating and irreverent Clare and everything he thought he knew begins to shift - setting off a chain of events that will determine each of their fates. From the award-winning author of The Dream House and The White Room comes Craig Higginson's most gripping and nuanced novel to date. Moving from the lush beaches of uMhlanga Rocks to the stark midwinter wastes of Johannesburg and the rich and strange coral reefs of Mauritius, this masterfully plotted novel explores the fault-lines between loyalty and betrayal, innocence and accountability, blindness and perception, entrapment and flight. The Book of Gifts dives into the deepest and most hazardous reaches of human consciousness in order to catch the brightest fish.""",,1770107002,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/1770107002.jpg

He never returned. Years later, Ruru goes to Tanzania in search of the remnants of his life. He finds it in his widow and his 'Pillow books'- journals he kept while coming to terms with his mortality. Struck by the parallels with her teenage letters to her late mother, she reads to find answers to her questions: Who was he? Why did he not return? She reads to find a sense of belonging in the world. Informed by Africa's recent history and examining its effects on ordinary family lives, this novel depicts the resilience of the people of the continent. A story of parting ways and the merging of spirits, bound by blood and undeclared immutable love, The Wanderers is an atmopheric novel that lingers unforgettably in the mind""--",,0795710046,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/0795710046.jpg

They play with my body and mind, forcing me to join in. Forcing me to like it. But things become increasingly dangerous as I find out the real reason they took me. And it becomes more and more apparent what I need to do to keep both my body and my heart safe...run.

With this mesmerizing tale of one woman's potent affliction, award-winning Finnish writer Laura Lindstedt makes her American debut. Narrated by an unnamed, ungendered therapist who leaps at the chance to employ their most experimental methods, My Friend Natalia offers a gripping examination of the power dynamics always present but rarely ever spoken about in therapy. ""Something flared within me,"" the therapist notes, ""and it wasn't merely sympathy, the emotion I feel for most of my clients. It was more like a sudden experience of harmony, wholly inappropriate given the circumstances."" It is clear from the moment Natalia barges into her new therapist's office that she has motives beyond simply fixing her sex life. She is quick to mention that the same exact painting hanging on the therapist's wall-an abstract piece titled Ear-Mouth-once hung in her grandmother's living room. This comment deeply unsettles the therapist, as does the large alarm clock that Natalia brings with her, intent on timing the sessions herself. And the tape recorder. At first, Natalia seems to play along with the rules of therapy. She partakes in the therapist's pain-displacement exercises, word games, and even produces a few anatomical illustrations. She muses on the art of pornography, and boldly examines seminal figures like Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre, about whom she poses the question, ""Did Jean-Paul consider Simone a woman at all? Or was she nothing but a pencil sharpener?"" By combining philosophy and literature, repressed childhood memories and explicitly unrepressed erotic experiences, the sessions quickly shed all inhibitions. Still, the therapist can't help but wonder: What does Natalia really want?",,9.78163E+12,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9781631498183.jpg

Lord Henri-Antoine has returned from the Grand Tour to a life of privilege and excess. A vast inheritance allows him every indulgence, free from responsibility. Yet, Henri-Antoine maintains a well-ordered existence, going to great lengths to conceal an affliction few understand and many fear.

Miss Lisa Crisp is a penniless orphan who relies on the charity of relatives to keep her from the poorhouse. Intelligent and unflappable, Lisa will not allow poverty to define her. She leads a useful life working among the sick poor.

Under startling circumstances, Henri-Antoine and Lisa meet. There is instant attraction. When they find themselves attending the same wedding in the country, Henri-Antoine offers Lisa a scandalous proposition, one she should refuse but yearns to accept.

His neighbour on the plane is a loquacious Irishman who speaks openly about many things, including the loss of his own father. Over the course of their thirteen-hour flight, the two form a genuine connection, sharing their thoughts, fears and ideas about life and death. A man with high anxiety, Chisoni analyses his childhood, his family, and the events that led to his brother's untimely death. He is consumed with guilt for his role in his brother's decline. In his jacket pocket is a note, addressed to their father, handwritten by his brother shortly before his death. In a drunken hand, it begins: Dad, I've been trying to meet you but all efforts are proving futile ... Chisoni cannot bring himself to look at the note, let alone deliver it. Is it his duty to fulfil his brother's request, or will doing so only break their father's heart? Thought-provoking and at times humorous, this honest account of grief embraces the themes of addiction, brotherhood, and the relationship of fathers and sons.

For the past decade, Walter Benjamin--the German-Jewish critic and philosopher--has been writing his masterpiece in a library in Paris, a city he loves. Now Nazi tanks have overrun the suburbs, and Benjamin is forced to flee. With a battered briefcase that contains his precious manuscript of a thousand handwritten pages, he sets off for the border and is led by chance to a young anti-Nazi who is taking Jews and other refugees over the Pyrenees into Spain, where they may (with luck) make their way to freedom in Portugal or South America. Beloved biographical novelist Jay Parini's thrilling tale of escape is beautifully interwoven with vignettes of Benjamin's complex, cosmopolitan past: his privileged childhood in Berlin, his years with the German Youth Movement, his university days. His close friendship with Gershom Scholem, the eminent scholar of Jewish mysticism, and many other well-known artists and intellectuals who were part of Benjamin's intimate circle between the two world wars. Part tragedy, part dark comedy, this sharply realized historical novel tells one of the great and most moving peripheral stories of the Holocaust."" --Amazon.",,0525562753,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/0525562753.jpg

After fifteen years of exile, Yammie, a young Innu woman, returns to her home in the Uashat nation on Quebec's North Shore. She has come back to teach language and drama at the community's school, but finds a community stalked by despair. Yammie will do anything to rescue her students. When she accepts a position directing the end-of-year play, she sees an opportunity for the youth to take charge of themselves. In writing both spare and polyphonic, Naomi Fontaine honestly portrays a year of Yammie's teaching and of the lives of her students, dislocated, abandoned, and ultimately, possibly, triumphant.""--",,1487008147,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/1487008147.jpg

Featuring twenty-three stories, John Michael Cummings’s debut story collection brims with the vitality and complexity of our shared humanity. In tales that conjure comparisons to John Updike, Raymond Carver, and William Gay, Cummings tells the truth about loneliness, relationships, and the common struggles we all face with prose both precise and vibrant. Cummings’s voice, assured yet questioning, will stay with you long after you’ve finished The Spirit in My Shoes.​​

Age twelve, Udonwa has a peculiar love of her father, Reverend Leonard Ilechukwu, who favours her but beats his wife and his other children. She sees his good side: after all, he pays the school fees in advance, and tells her that she, named 'the peaceful child', is the one most likely to become a doctor in the family. But luck doesn't last forever. When her newly married eldest sister suddenly takes her from their family compound in Iruama, Nigeria, to live with her in Awka, Udonwa experiences violence first-hand. Later, pieces of a sinister picture emerge that shake her life to the core. No longer the person she thought she was, Udonwa launches into a period of extreme change, and parts of her life spiral into chaos as she finds herself torn between her love for her father and an underlying need to free herself."" --",,1485904471,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/1485904471.jpg

Ari is always right. Ari is also imaginary. And winged. In a few hours, while Ari plays both angel and demon on his shoulder, our man will end up joyriding to a brothel in a snatched tourist rental car. But the police - and the burly tourists - are in pursuit. At some point, when you're a hunted man and there's a gun tucked in the waistband of your pants, things come to a head. Will he be okay?

Lila is on a long, painful journey toward motherhood. Tess and Emily are reeling after their ugly separation and fighting over ownership of the embryos that were supposed to grow their family together. And thousands of miles away, the unknown man who served as anonymous donor to them all is being held in captivity in Somalia. While his life remains in precarious balance, his genetic material is a source of both creation and conflict. What does it mean to be a family in our rapidly shifting world? What are our responsibilities to each other with increasing options for how to create a family? As these characters grapple with life-altering changes, they will find themselves interconnected in ways they cannot have imagined, and forced to redefine what family means to them.""--",,0385678096,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/0385678096.jpg

A mother walks an emotional tightrope, for her two sons - a police officer and an underground rebel - fight on opposite sides of the Assam insurgency.

How to Tell the Story of an Insurgency is an unflinching account of a war India has been fighting in the margins. Written originally in Assamese, Bodo and English, the fifteen stories in this book attempt to humanize the longstanding, bloody conflict that the rest of India knows of only through facts and figures or reports in newspapers and on television channels.""--Provided by publisher.",,9353576520,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9353576520.jpg

Having eluded the public confessions at the TRC for his time in the Border Wars, he retained his position in the democratic South Africa, serving as institutional memory for a new generation of police recruits.
